## ✅ Task 1: Web Scraping

### Objective
To collect real-world textual data from a public website and create a structured dataset for analysis.

### Description
- Data was scraped from a public practice website using Python.
- The dataset contains quotes and their respective authors.
- Libraries used: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`

### Output
- Dataset file: `quotes_dataset.csv`
- Columns:
  - Quote
  - Author

## ✅ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objective
To explore and understand the structure and characteristics of the scraped dataset.

### Analysis Performed
- Dataset structure and data types
- Missing value detection
- Feature engineering (quote length)
- Statistical summary
- Data visualization

### Visualizations
- Distribution of quote lengths
- Top authors by number of quotes

### Output
- Cleaned dataset: `cleaned_quotes_dataset.csv`
